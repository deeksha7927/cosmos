			       <li>About 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Aquila, there is a cloud of alcohol with a diameter 1,000 times larger than our solar system. </li>
			       <li>If you have ever wished there were more hours in the day, just be patient. Every century, Earth’s rotation slows down by about 1.4 milliseconds.</li>
			       <li>Quasars occur when gas swirls around a black hole very quickly, and friction causes it to heat up, emitting light.</li>
                   <li>Pulsars are magnetized neutron stars that spin incredibly fast and blast out a beam of radiation, kind of like a lighthouse beacon. The fastest known pulsar is PSR J1748-2446ad, located around 18,000 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius</li>

Each road, or "filament," on this intergalactic interstate is made of hydrogen left over from the Big Bang; where large quantities of hydrogen converge, clusters of galaxies appear in the dark sea of space. The web is too faint to see with the naked eye, but in October, astronomers photographed a piece of it for the first time ever. <a href="#">Read more</a></td>

        		<td class="desc">In September, astronomers detected one of the fastest renegade stars ever recorded, fleeing across the Milky Way at 1.2 million mph (2 million km/h). Most stars moving at such blazing speeds are usually the survivors of a binary system that got ripped in half by a supermassive black hole or exploding supernova, but this speedy sun appeared to be different. <a href="#">Read more</a></td>
